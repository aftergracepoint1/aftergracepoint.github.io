Now that you've left, what next?

# Give yourself space

You will most likely go through intense emotions from relief, to sorrow, to lightness, to confusion. 

It's going to be a long time before your life feels normal. A lot of what you've known for probably many years is now torn away. For years, you imagined a certain life for yourself, but now that's no longer the path you're going to walk. While in Gracepoint, what is "right" and "wrong" is clearly laid out for you, but now that you're out, you'll have to reconstruct your own moral framework.

Acknowledge how hard this is. Tell yourself it's OKAY to feel all the feelings and not know what to do with them. All we can say is: you aren't alone. Many have been in your shoes. You'll make it through!

# It's okay to have doubts

Just because you have doubts doesn't mean you've made a wrong decision. Trust that your past self did due diligence. 

Again, acknowledge how hard this all is. It's painful to say goodbye to good friendships and cherished memories. Many of us first experienced the joy of the gospel and the joy of being a minister at Gracepoint. It's okay to name all the good things about Gracepoint that you miss. But also consider again why you left, and after comparing the two, see where the scale tips.

# It's okay to not go to church yet

This sounds scandalous at first, but seriously: it's okay, and probably good, to not immediately jump into searching for another church. 

For many, being in a church may be triggering and may not feel like a safe space. Your priority after leaving is to find healing and closure, and jumping right back into church can get in the way of that, if you jump in for the wrong reasons.

If you're desiring to immediately find a church, consider whether it is out of love for God and wanting to love others vs. wanting to prove to Gracepoint people that you're still a committed Christian who is spiritually thriving.
