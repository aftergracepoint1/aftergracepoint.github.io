### Who is this site for?

This site is for anyone seeking to learn more about Gracepoint.
It is particularly geared towards those thinking of leaving and those who have recently left.

### What is this site about?

If you’ve ever felt like something felt “off” at Gracepoint but couldn’t put your finger on it… this site is for you. This site exists to put words to those feelings.

### Mission Statement

Our goals are to:

1. Inform the public, especially current Gracepoint members, about the inner workings of Gracepoint that only fully reveal themselves after years of involvement.

2. Acknowledge and bring to light the stories of those who have been systemically hurt by Gracepoint.

3. Provide resources and a sense of community for those who have left and are putting their lives back together.

After hundreds of testimonies across multiple decades have surfaced, it has become clear that the issues we present go well beyond isolated events caused by individual bad actors.

We do not seek to "reform" the church. Our mission is simply to equip people, especially those who have been hurt, with information, resources, and community.

This site was created by former Gracepoint members and staff. We speak from years - and some from decades - of experience.
