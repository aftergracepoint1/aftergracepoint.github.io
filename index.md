### Who is this site for?

This site is for anyone seeking to learn more about Gracepoint.
It is particularly geared towards those thinking of leaving and those who have recently left.

### What is this site about?

If you’ve ever felt like something felt “off” at Gracepoint but couldn’t put your finger on it… this site is for you. This site exists to put words to those feelings.

### Mission Statement

Our goals are to:

1. Inform the public, especially current Gracepoint members, about the inner workings of Gracepoint that only fully reveal themselves after years of involvement.

2. Acknowledge and bring to light the stories of those who have been systemically hurt by Gracepoint.

3. Provide resources and a sense of community for those who have left and are putting their lives back together.

After reading hundreds of testimonies across multiple decades, it has become clear that Gracepoint has a spiritually abusive culture that is by design, rather than isolated events caused by bad actors here and there.

Because of this, our mission is to equip people with information, rather than seeking to “reform” the church.

This site was created by former Gracepoint members and staff. We speak from years - and some from decades - of experience.
