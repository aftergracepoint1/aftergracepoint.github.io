Gracepoint is well-aware of its criticisms and has made a lot of effort to respond to them publicly. It is admirable that they take feedback seriously, and we hope that constructive conversations may continue between the church and individuals.

As mentioned elsewhere, the purpose of this site is not to reform Gracepoint, and any analysis of the responses feels out of our scope.

Thus, we will simply provide links to responses from both sides and allow the reader to judge for themselves.
