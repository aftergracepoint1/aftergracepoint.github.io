# Get Connected

Whether you’re just checking out Gracepoint, been a member for years, or have already left, all are welcomed! 

The two main ways to get connected are:

1. [/r/GracepointChurch](https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/) on Reddit: A discussion forum. If you have a specific question or topic you want to talk about and you want thought-out answers from a variety of people, this is the place to go.

2. [After Gracepoint Discord](https://discord.gg/shUNTVqKp8): An online chat room. Voice rooms are there if you need them. If you just want to talk to people who have been in your shoes, Discord’s your best bet.

Both Reddit and Discord are anonymous platforms. As long as you don’t share your real name, you will remain fully anonymous.
