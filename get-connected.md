Whether youâ€™re just checking out Gracepoint, been a member for years, or have already left, there's a place for you. 

The two main ways to get connected are:

1. [ðŸ”—/r/GracepointChurch](https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/) on Reddit: A discussion forum. If you have a specific question or topic you want to talk about and you want answers from a variety of people, this is the place to go. It's also the best place to read individual accounts on their experience at Gracepoint.

<!-- 2. [Facebook Group](todo): For people who left Gracepoint to connect with each other as they find healing, closure, and help others do the same. You must use your real identity here.

3. A Discord server is being considered for people wanting to chat in real-time, but remain anonymous. If this is something that would appeal to you, please [upvote here](https://app.loopedin.io/after-gracepoint?idea=635403779ba0fd002ad4003c#/ideas). -->

2. [ðŸ”—After Gracepoint Discord](https://discord.gg/shUNTVqKp8): An online chat room. If you just want to casually talk, this is your best bet. 

3. [ðŸ”—Sisters Only Facebook Group](https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/xbsx3n/sisters_there_is_a_safety_net_for_you_now/): An invite-only support group run by Lillian Chung with about ____ members. This group is limited to women who left during their post-grad years, since post-grad experience is so different from the student experience.
