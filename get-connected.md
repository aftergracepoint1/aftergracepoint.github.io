Whether you’re just checking out Gracepoint, been a member for years, or have already left, there's a place for you. 

The two main ways to get connected are:

1. [/r/GracepointChurch](https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/) on Reddit: A discussion forum. If you have a specific question or topic you want to talk about and you want thought-out answers from a variety of people, this is the place to go. It's also the best place to read individual accounts on their experience at Gracepoint.

2. [Facebook Group](todo): For people who left Gracepoint to connect with each other as they find healing, closure, and help others do the same. You must use your real identity here.

3. A Discord server is being considered for people wanting to chat in real-time, but remain anonymous. If this is something that would appeal to you, please [upvote here](https://app.loopedin.io/after-gracepoint?idea=635403779ba0fd002ad4003c#/ideas).

<!-- 2. [After Gracepoint Discord](https://discord.gg/shUNTVqKp8): An online chat room. Voice rooms are there if you need them. If you just want to talk to people who have been in your shoes, Discord’s your best bet. -->

<!-- Both Reddit and Discord are anonymous platforms. As long as you don’t share your real name, you will remain fully anonymous. -->
