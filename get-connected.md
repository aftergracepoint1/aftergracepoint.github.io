Whether youâ€™re just checking out Gracepoint, been a member for years, or have already left, there's a place for you. 

1. [ðŸ”—/r/GracepointChurch](https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/){:target="_blank"} on Reddit: A discussion forum. If you have a specific question or topic you want to talk about and you want answers from a variety of people, this is the place to go. It's also the best place to read individual accounts on their experience at Gracepoint.
2. [ðŸ”—After Gracepoint Discord](https://discord.gg/shUNTVqKp8){:target="_blank"}: An online chatroom. If you just want to casually chat, this is your best bet.
3. [ðŸ”—Sisters Only Facebook Group](https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/xbsx3n/sisters_there_is_a_safety_net_for_you_now/){:target="_blank"}: An invite-only support group run by Lillian Chung with about ____ members. This group is limited to women who left during their post-grad years, since post-grad experience is so different from the student experience.
