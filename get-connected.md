Whether you’re just checking out Gracepoint, been a member for years, or have already left, there's a place for you. 

The two main ways to get connected are:

1. [🔗/r/GracepointChurch](https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/) on Reddit: A discussion forum. If you have a specific question or topic you want to talk about and you want answers from a variety of people, this is the place to go. It's also the best place to read individual accounts on their experience at Gracepoint.

<!-- 2. [Facebook Group](todo): For people who left Gracepoint to connect with each other as they find healing, closure, and help others do the same. You must use your real identity here.

3. A Discord server is being considered for people wanting to chat in real-time, but remain anonymous. If this is something that would appeal to you, please [upvote here](https://app.loopedin.io/after-gracepoint?idea=635403779ba0fd002ad4003c#/ideas). -->

2. [🔗After Gracepoint Discord](https://discord.gg/shUNTVqKp8): An online chat room. If you just want to casually talk, this is your best bet. 

Both Reddit and Discord are anonymous platforms. As long as you don’t share your real name, you will remain fully anonymous.
