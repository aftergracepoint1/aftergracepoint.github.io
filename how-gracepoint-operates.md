(to do: this is very rough, just mostly stream of consciousness at the moment. Most likely it needs to be edited down.)

What makes Gracepoint's spiritual abuse often hard to pin down is that it tends to be couched in reasonable, spiritual-sounding language. This page, while not exhaustive, attempts to give some real-world examples of Gracepoint's operations with primary sources.

### How Gracepoint Discipleship Begins

Gracepoint has a highly structured approach to discipleship. Each year, from freshman year through senior year, college students follow a fairly set "track" of maturation. This allows entire classes of young men and women to be discipled together, which is remarkably efficient.

Courtesy of a former staff member, a handout describing this approach in detail can be found here: 
[College Ministry Growth Goals](https://i.imgur.com/Sd1wR5t.jpg){:target="_blank"}

Every new Gracepoint member must pass the following courses: Course 101 --> Survival Kit 1 --> Church 101 --> Survival Kit 2

- Each course takes about a semester, involving readings and homework that go into great detail about Gracepoint's brand of faith & church life.
- Passing each of these "courses" requires you to not only *learn* Gracepoint's worldview, but also *affirm it as your own."
- Passing the courses is met with public celebration, while disagreeing with the material is seen as being held back by sinful desires.
- Passing the courses is also required to attend many church events & meetings. It's safe to say there is a high amount of pressure to pass.

The result is a cookie-cutter approach where anyone who doesn't fit in, is forced to fit.

- It doesn't matter if you've already accepted Christ at another church. You have to re-accept Christ at Gracepoint (via Course 101) to continue on the discipleship track. Also, if your testimony isn't approved by your leader, they will refuse to baptize you.
- It doesn't matter if you're a Pastor's kid or a brand new seeker. What matters is if you are a freshman or a senior. If you're a freshman, you have to take Course 101 (the intro to Christianity course). If you're a senior, you're expected to serve and reach out to freshmen. It doesn't matter that the freshman in this case was a Pastor's kid and lived/breathed the gospel for 18 years, while the senior was an unchurched, brand new convert.
- It doesn't matter if you're a star athlete. If you can't make it to every Friday night bible study, you're struggling (and probably idolizing sports in this case).
- It is worth noting the emphasis on things like "How they view staff" and "Start serving" rather than growing in their relationship with God, growing in their prayer life, or growing as individuals.

### How Gracepoint Discipleship Continues

**Members Bible Study (MBS):** Once you graduate college and become a full member, you are allowed to attend MBS. MBS is a special "extra" church service for members-only, always led by Pastor Ed. The idea is that the public church service is geared towards seekers, which waters it down for believers. This is true; however, in practice, it has become a time where Gracepoint's worldview (well beyond the Bible) is preached as gospel, and Pastor Ed is given free rein to air more extreme views without fear of having his words "misinterpreted" by the public.
During this time, Pastor Ed is known to be a lot looser with his words, frequently involving offensive jokes or "un-PC" opinions.
An example: when explaining an illustration involving an electric circuit, he made a comment, "I'm explaining this because there are sisters in the room," to which the audience chuckled.
The result is an echo chamber where opinionated worldviews are reaffirmed until they are indistinguishable from the Word of God.

**Weekly Reflections (WR):** After graduating college, you are required to write reflections every Sunday. There are typically three sections:
- How did the Word of God speak to you? (the sermon)
- What are you thankful for?
- What are you struggling with? (confess your sins in writing)
The catch is that you are *required* to send your reflections to your designated church leader. Everything you write will be judged by your leader. Your leader, out of an *abundance of love*, may also share your reflections with their friends to pray for you. 

### How Gracepoint Views Itself

Gracepoint is aware of the backlash it receives for its practices. In fact, it has extensive documentation on responses to common questions.

This isn't the place for a line-by-line analysis, so we'll try to summarize a few key takeaways:
- It's interesting that this document even exists. Why does a church need 11 pages to tell people "we aren't the bad guys?"
- Strawmen defenses are the norm. Example:
	- Question (quoted): Why do leaders meddle in people's lives, and have so much authority and say here?
	- Answer (summarized): Look at all these other organizations (police, schools, etc) with leadership structures. Without leadership structures, an organization is aimless and nothing gets done. We don't want our church to be aimless. Plus, here are a bunch of bible verses about obeying and submitting.
	- Analysis: Somehow, a logical jump is made that because having *a* leadership structure is better than none, having *any* leadership structure is justified.
- Misleading language is used. For example, "We discourage dating."
	- Is it a simple "discouragement" if, among 1,000 singles aged 18-21, there are *zero* dating couples?
	- Is it a simple "discouragement" if dating means you are disallowed from attending retreats, prayer meetings, and other functions?
	- Is it a simple "discouragement" if you are only permitted to date someone when your leader decides both of you are "mature enough?"
- "Everything is permissible-- but not everything is beneficial"
	- This verse is frequently used as a blanket justification of any extra-biblical stance or rule
	- Gracepoint will frequently say something is "permissible, but simply discouraged," but in practice, revoke privileges to participate in activities/ministry until you conform to the standard.
	- This covers a wide range of things, such as:
		- listening to non-Christian music (don't)
		- owning a TV (don't)
		- playing video games (don't)
		- owning a pet (don't)
		- the way your house is organized
		- the way you dress and the length of your hair
		- the brand of car you drive (generally must be Toyota, Honda or Ford)
		- being roommates with anyone who isn't a member of Gracepoint (even just a buddy of yours)
		- dating anyone who isn't a member of Gracepoint

Ironically, in an interview posted on [Gracepoint Under The Hood](https://www.gracepointonline.org/church-culture-and-practices){:target="_blank"}, Pastor Ed claims his ministry is "very organic" and "thereâ€™s no formula."

Even more ironically, Gracepoint leadership, as much as it prides itself in its strong stances and boundaries, isn't above breaking a few rules itself. During the start of COVID-19 when testing was scarce, Gracepoint handed out these [COVID-19 test requisition forms](https://i.imgur.com/DbqKVKI.jpg) to its members. Interestingly, they were signed by an orthopedist, and the email was linked to Steve Suh (a Gracepoint ministry lead, not a doctor), and the "primary practice" address was 1275 Harbor Bay Parkway, which is Gracepoint's HQ. "Everything is permissible" indeed.

### How Gracepoint Views Outsiders

**People looking to join**
People looking to join Gracepoint typically fall into two groups: 
	- A) Students (usually college or high school, but can also be graduate school)
	- B) Everyone else
If you fall into group A, everyone is unbelievably friendly and almost unnervingly accommodating to you. It's like people see you for who you are. However, behind the scenes, you are seen as an aimless child with the upside of being another a notch on a conversion belt. In Gracepoint's [own words](https://i.imgur.com/9zq4dZf.png), "we are dealing with an emotionally fragile generation who have hardly ever been corrected by their parents."
If you fall into group B, you are gently but firmly separated from everyone else. [to do: expand upon this a bit]

**Other churches**
It is common practice for Gracepoint leadership to spotlight the struggles of other churches, and juxtapose them with Gracepoint's own successes.
[to do: need examples!!!]

Citing a difference of values, Gracepoint does not partner with other churches in its ministry opportunities.
