This page attempts to give some real-world examples of Gracepoint's inner workings, with primary sources that allow you to draw your own conclusions.

### How Gracepoint Discipleship Begins

Gracepoint has a structured approach to discipleship. From freshman to senior, college students follow a fairly set "track" of spiritual growth. This allows entire classes of young men and women to be discipled together, which is remarkably efficient.

**Primary Source:

Every new member takes the following courses, in-order: 
1. Course 101
2. Survival Kit 1
3. Church 101
4. Survival Kit 2

**What are these courses?**
- Each course takes about a semester and involves readings and homework.
- Course 101 is a basic introduction to Christianity, drawing a lot of material from books like Mere Christianity (C.S. Lewis) and Basic Christianity (John Stott). 
- Survival Kit 1, Church 101, and Survival Kit 2 are more application-focused and go into detail about what healthy church life & (non-romantic) relationships should look like

**There is a lot at stake**
- Passing each of these courses requires you to not only *learn* Gracepoint's worldview, but also *affirm it as your own."
- The final question of Course 101 asks whether you are ready to publicly accept Christ as your Lord and Savior. After answering ‘yes,’ you are celebrated with praise, flowers, and gifts.
- Some church meetings & retreats require you to have passed all of the courses to attend
- Disagreeing with the material is typically seen as being held back by fears or worldly desires, and is something to be prayed through

[Unsure if this is needed, might come across too strongly]
The result is a cookie-cutter approach where anyone who doesn't fit in either forces themselves to fit, or leaves the church.
- It doesn't matter if you've already accepted Christ at another church. You have to re-accept Christ at Gracepoint (via Course 101) to continue on the discipleship track. Also, if your testimony isn't approved by your leader, they will refuse to baptize you.
- It doesn't matter if you're a Pastor's kid or a brand new seeker. What matters is if you are a freshman or a senior. If you're a freshman, you have to take Course 101 (the intro to Christianity course). If you're a senior, you're expected to serve and reach out to freshmen. It doesn't matter that the freshman in this case was a Pastor's kid and lived/breathed the gospel for 18 years, while the senior was an unchurched, brand new convert.
- It doesn't matter if you're a star athlete. If you can't make it to every Friday night bible study, you're struggling (and probably idolizing sports in this case).
- It is worth noting the emphasis on things like "How they view staff" and "Start serving" rather than growing in their relationship with God, growing in their prayer life, or growing as individuals.

### How Gracepoint Discipleship Continues

**Members Bible Study (MBS):** MBS is a mandatory extra church service for members-only, led by Pastor Ed. The idea is that the public church service is geared towards seekers, while MBS preaches more advanced topics for members that might be misunderstood by the general public.

During this time, Pastor Ed is often looser with his words, sometimes letting offensive jokes or "un-PC" opinions slip through. For example, when explaining an illustration involving an electric circuit, he made a comment, "I'm explaining this because there are sisters in the room," to which the audience chuckled.

**Weekly Reflections (WR):** In addition to your daily ~1 hour devotionals, you are required to write WR’s every Sunday. There are typically three sections:
- How did the Word of God speak to you? (the sermon)
- What are you thankful for?
- What are you struggling with? (confess your sins in writing)
It is mandatory to email your reflections to your designated leader, who helps keep you accountable for your sins. Your leader, out of an abundance of love, may also share the content of your reflections with their friends, your friends, or anyone else in the church who might be affected by your sins.

### How Gracepoint Views Itself

Gracepoint is aware of the backlash it receives for its practices. In fact, it has extensive documentation on responses to common questions.

**Primary Source:** [Gracepoint's Answers to Commonly Asked Questions](https://i.redd.it/wpgtcn6bh7b81.jpg){:target="_blank"}

Read the document for yourself. We'll try to summarize a few of our __opinions__:
- It's interesting that this document even exists. Why does a church need 11 pages to tell people "we are the good guys?"

**Strawman arguments**
Here’s an example: 
- Question (quoted): Why do leaders meddle in people's lives, and have so much authority and say here?
- Answer (summarized): Look at all these other organizations (police, schools, etc) with leadership structures. Without leadership structures, an organization is aimless and nothing gets done. We don't want our church to be aimless. Also, here are bible verses about obeying and submitting.

Somehow, a logical jump is made that because having *a* leadership structure is better than none, having *any* leadership structure is justified. 

Never addressed: what keeps Gracepoint’s top leadership in check? The closest answer from the document is "fear that something can be abused is not adequate grounds for invalidating it altogether." The assumption seems to be that the top leadership is made out of special incorruptible stuff, and there is no reason to fear them.

**Misleading language*
Example: "We discourage dating."
- Is it a simple "discouragement" if, among ~1,000 singles across churches, aged 18-21, there are *zero* dating couples?
- Is it a simple "discouragement" if dating means you are disallowed from attending retreats, prayer meetings, and other events with your friends?
- Is it a simple "discouragement" if you are only permitted to date someone when your leader decides both of you are "mature enough?"
- Using words like "discouraged" instead of "prohibited," the church is able to maintain an appearance that thousands of individuals *just happen to* arrive at the same conclusion.

**Everything is permissible*
"Everything is permissible-- but not everything is beneficial"
This verse is frequently used to justify Gracepoint’s stances against various activities or ways of life. At Gracepoint, you are free to do as you please - nothing is prohibited. However, for your own protection, if you take part in non-beneficial behaviors, you may lose privileges to do things like participate in ministry, go on dates, or attend certain events with friends. Some examples:
- listening to non-Christian music (don't)
- owning a TV (don't)
- playing video games (don't)
- owning a pet (don't)
- the way your house is organized
- the way you dress and the length of your hair
- the brand of car you drive (generally must be Toyota, Honda or Ford)
- being roommates with anyone who isn't a member of Gracepoint (even just a buddy of yours)
- not having roommates
- dating anyone who isn't a member of Gracepoint

**All organic, no formula**
In an interview posted on [Gracepoint Under The Hood](https://www.gracepointonline.org/church-culture-and-practices){:target="_blank"}, Pastor Ed claims his ministry is "very organic" and "there’s no formula." We will leave it to the reader to decide if those descriptions are accurate.

[NEEDS FACT CHECK/CONTEXT]
**Everything is permissible… for the leadership**
Ironically, Gracepoint leadership, as much as it prides itself in its strong stances and boundaries, isn't above breaking a rule or two itself. During the start of COVID-19 when testing was scarce, Gracepoint handed out test request forms to its members, which would allow them to get tested before the general public. Interestingly, they were signed by an *orthopedist*, and the email was linked to Steve Suh (one of the top Gracepoint ministry leaders, not a doctor), and the "primary practice" address was 1275 Harbor Bay Parkway, which is Gracepoint's HQ.

### How Gracepoint Views Outsiders

**New attendees**
People looking to join Gracepoint typically fall into two groups: 
- A) Students (usually college freshmen, but also new grad students)
- B) Everyone else
If you fall into group A, everyone is astonishingly friendly and accommodating to your every need. It's like people see you for who you are. However, behind the scenes, you are seen as immature, lost and in need of a strong guiding hand. In Gracepoint's [own words](https://i.imgur.com/9zq4dZf.png), "we are dealing with an emotionally fragile generation who have hardly ever been corrected by their parents."

If you fall into group B, you are gently separated from everyone else and recommended to find a different church. Gracepoint is, by design, very focused on the college demographic - specifically from freshman year, as outlined in the College Ministry Goals document. By specializing, the church avoids spreading itself too thin. The result is a highly efficient church. We leave it up to the reader to decide if it is a healthy model.

**Other churches**

Gracepoint leadership has been known to spotlight the struggles of other churches, and juxtapose them with Gracepoint's own successes.

"Country club churches" where nothing happens?
etc.
