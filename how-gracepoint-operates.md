(to do: this is very rough, just mostly stream of consciousness at the moment)

What makes Gracepoint's spiritual abuse hard to pin down is that it is often couched in reasonable, spiritual-sounding language. 

### How Gracepoint Discipleship Works

Gracepoint has a highly structured approach to discipleship. Each year, from freshman year through senior year, college students follow a fairly set "track" of maturation. This allows entire classes of young men and women to be discipled together, which is remarkably efficient.

Courtesy of a former staff member, a handout describing this approach in detail can be found here:

The flip side of this cookie-cutter approach is that anyone who doesn't fit in, is forced to fit.

- It doesn't matter if you've already accepted Christ at another church. You have to re-accept Christ at Gracepoint to continue on the discipleship track. Also, if your testimony isn't approved by your leader, they will refuse to baptize you.
- It doesn't matter if you're a Pastor's kid or a brand new seeker. What matters is if you are a freshman or a senior. If you're a freshman, you have to take Course 101 (the intro to Christianity course). If you're a senior, you're expected to serve and reach out to freshmen. It doesn't matter that the freshman in this case was a Pastor's kid and lived/breathed the gospel for 18 years, while the senior was an unchurched, brand new convert.
- It doesn't matter if you're a star athlete. If you can't make it to every Friday night bible study, you're struggling (and probably idolizing sports in this case).
- It is worth noting the emphasis on things like "How they view staff" and "Start serving" rather than growing in their relationship with God, growing in their prayer life, or growing as individuals.

When you come to Gracepoint as a freshman, your previous beliefs are thrown out the window to make room for the Gracepoint way: Course 101 --> SK1 --> Church 101 --> SK2
Each of these courses require you to affirm your acceptance of Gracepoint's values and specific interpretation of the gospel as your own.

Merriam-Webster defines brainwashing as 1) a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas 

Take it as you will.
